I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment


This project uses sliders and JRadioButtons for the majority of the GUI interaction.
there are 7 Colors and 5 Effects to choose from

there are several imports used, mostly graphics2D shapes and awt classes
all are in the standard Java library
therefore there are no special procedures for running this program.
